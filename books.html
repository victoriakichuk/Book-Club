                        Norwegian Wood (ノルウェイの森, Noruwei no Mori) is a 1987 novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami. 
                        The novel is a nostalgic story of loss and burgeoning sexuality. 
                        It is told from the first-person perspective of Toru Watanabe, who looks back on his days as a college student living in Tokyo. 
                        Through Watanabe's reminiscences, readers see him develop relationships with two very different women—the beautiful yet emotionally troubled Naoko, and the outgoing, lively Midori.
